The first three WODs were not as hard as I thought. I finished them in 10 min or less.

The First WOD reminded me of HTML day in ICS 101 where you are taught HTML and how to make your site nice without a CSS and how to commit changes.

The second WOD was with the CSS so it took a little longer. I knew how to link my CSS and make the CSS formated so it would look like the example and I did it very fast. The only thing I had a problem with was the colums 

The third WOD was more time consuming as you had to make new pages and attach the style sheet to each of them and edit the CSS. 

Over all, the first three WODs were not that hard just time consuming to get them the way the example looked.
